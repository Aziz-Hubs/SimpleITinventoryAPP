# Documentation Audit & Technical Review Summary

This document summarizes the comprehensive documentation audit and technical review performed on the IT Inventory Management application. The goal was to implement professional-grade TSDoc/JSDoc documentation across core layers while identifying architectural refactoring opportunities.

## 1. Documentation Standards Applied

Every documented file now adheres to the following structural principles:

- **File Headers**: Descriptive `@file`, `@description`, and `@path` tags.
- **Explain the "Why"**: Documentation focuses on the rationale behind complex logic (e.g., adaptive column visibility, optimistic UI updates) rather than obvious implementation details.
- **TSDoc/JSDoc Standard**: All exported functions, hooks, interfaces, and components include standardized metadata.
- **Type Safety**: Parameters and return types are explicitly documented where TypeScript inference alone might leave room for ambiguity.

## 2. Key Areas Documented

### Core Infrastructure (`lib/`)

- **`api-client.ts`**: Documented the robust error handling, request/response logging, and the mock data injection strategy.
- **Types**: Thoroughly documented `Asset`, `Employee`, `Maintenance`, and `Common` types, including Zod schema integration.

### Business Services (`services/`)

- **Mock logic**: Detailed how services simulate real API latency and handle local storage persistence.
- **Data Transformation**: Explained the "Bridge" logic between legacy JSON formats and modern TypeScript interfaces.

### Hooks & State (`hooks/`)

- **`useTableParams`**: Documented the URL-as-State synchronization logic.
- **Query Hooks**: Explained the standard query key factory pattern and complex invalidation strategies (e.g., invalidating both list and detail views on update).
- **Optimistic UI**: High-level explanation of the rollback logic used in asset assignment.

### Shared Components (`components/shared/`)

- **`DataTable`**: Documented the "Smart Component" pattern and the adaptive column visibility logic based on hardware categories.
- **`BaseDataTable`**: Explained the generic wrapper pattern and Slot-based toolbar system.
- **`SectionCards`**: Detailed the motion-driven grid and drill-down modal mechanics.

## 3. Technical Debt & Refactoring Opportunities (TODOs)

Several architectural "code smells" were identified and flagged with `// TODO: (Refactor)` comments for future sprints:

1.  **Duplicate Asset Models**: The codebase currently maintains both `Asset` and `AssetLegacy`. Several UI components still rely on the legacy format, leading to complex transformation logic.
    - _Recommendation_: Migrate all features to the modern `Asset` interface.
2.  **Hardcoded Authentication**: `maintenance-service.ts` uses a `CURRENT_USER` constant.
    - _Recommendation_: Integrate a proper `AuthContext` or Clerk/NextAuth.
3.  **Employee Metadata Management**: Employee details are currently derived dynamically from asset assignments.
    - _Recommendation_: Create a dedicated `employees.json` or database table to manage professional metadata (Department, Role, Manager) independently.
4.  **API Response Consistency**: Duplicate `ApiResponse` interfaces across `api-client.ts` and `common.ts`.
    - _Recommendation_: Centralize all network-layer types in `lib/types/api.ts`.

## 4. Final Review Status
