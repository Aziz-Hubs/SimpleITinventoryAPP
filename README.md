# Simple IT Inventory App

As a university student juggling my studies with a part-time job as a help desk associate, I've spent a lot of time with spreadsheets and outdated inventory systems that make tracking IT equipment a chore. After about six months of diving deep into programming, I decided to build something that would solve a real problem for myself and my team.

**Simple IT Inventory App** is my first major project, born from the daily challenges of IT support. It's a web-based application designed to make managing and tracking hardware assets simple, intuitive, and efficient, especially for small to medium-sized IT departments that might not have the budget for expensive enterprise solutions. This project is my attempt to apply what I'm learning and to build something genuinely useful.

## Key Features

- **Inventory Management:** Add, view, edit, and delete assets in a centralized inventory. Track detailed information for each piece of equipment.
- **Asset Assignment:** Assign assets to employees and easily view all equipment allocated to an individual.
- **Deployment Operations:** Manage the deployment of new hardware and track the status of ongoing operations.
- **Activity Dashboard:** View a log of recent activities and get a quick overview of inventory statistics.
- **Employee Directory:** Maintain a list of employees and their assigned assets.
- **Maintenance Tracking:** Log and monitor maintenance activities for all assets.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean and modern UI built with accessibility in mind.
